/* If the original .form-container class from a framework (e.g., Bootstrap)
   was providing other essential styles (like width, max-width, padding, etc.),
   those might need to be incorporated here or the .form-container class
   should be kept on the inner div if it doesn't conflict.
   For this task, we are primarily focused on replacing inline styles.
   The .form-container-overlay is designed to replace the inner div's styling.
